title: Towards causal modeling of nutritional outcomes
abstract: This paper aims at observational causal modelling, investigating the causal
  relationships between food consumption and health status, exploiting the proprietary
  Kantar database. This database describes the socioeconomic characteristics and consumption
  habits of a few dozen thousands households; in particular, the consumed food items
  are documented almost at the level of precision of barcodes. A first challenge for
  this observational causal study lies in the number of hidden confounders, ranging
  from genetic factors to life styles (i.e. smoking and sport habits), not documented
  in the data. Taking inspiration from the Deconfounder approach (Wang and Blei, 2019b),
  substitute hidden confounders based on dietary patterns − viewed as characteristics
  of the alimentary lifestyle − are extracted from the database and exploited to block
  the biases due to hidden confounders. A second challenge lies in the fact that the
  data size hardly allows for investigating a number of fine-grained interventions.
  We thus define a new type of intervention, enabled by the data structure and referred
  to as macro-intervention, acting on the full basket of food items; an example of
  such macro-intervention is to replace every non-organic product in a household basket
  with its organic counterpart. The average treatment effect of this macro-intervention
  is assessed in the context of the substitute hidden confounders, using inverse propensity
  weighted estimates to control for covariates such as wealth or education.
