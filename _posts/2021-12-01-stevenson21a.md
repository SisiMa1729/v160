title: Applying Causal Discovery to Intensive Longitudinal Data
abstract: "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) could be a solution for two problems
  in psychology: 1) In traditional experiments and survey studies, \fndings are not
  necessarily representative of the real-life constructs and relationships studied,
  and 2) Group-level analyses commonly mischaracterize or obscure relationships for
  individuals. Popular analytic methods within psychology are currently not well-equipped
  to use ILD for causal discovery and causal inference, however. We have performed
  the first causal discovery analysis on ILD, encountered some challenges, and developed
  some solutions to these challenges. This paper describes our application of causal
  discovery to an example ILD dataset, and addresses two particular challenges that
  arose: 1) How should one address variables measured on different timelines, and
  2) What number of observations is needed for individual-level analysis."
