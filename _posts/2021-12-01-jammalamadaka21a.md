title: Causal Abstraction Via Emergence for Predicting Bilateral Trade
abstract: Causal abstraction is key in finding efficient representations of noisy
  and complex systems, for decision-making and prediction of future system states.
  Hand-crafted causal abstractions, although accurate and interpretable, can be costly
  to construct and cannot generalize to large, novel datasets. In this paper, we explore
  the information-theoretic concept of causal emergence, its correspondence to recent
  definitions of causal abstraction, and the properties of emergent representations
  that enable more accurate state predictions and semantic interpretations. Using
  the bilateral trade network as a case study, we enumerate the conditions under which
  trade agreements exhibit causal emergence properties, and show that causally emergent
  representations are indeed able to provide better prediction capability than original
  trade network representations in a variety of cases.
