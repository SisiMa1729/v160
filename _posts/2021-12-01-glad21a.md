title: Path Signature Area-Based Causal Discovery in Coupled Time Series
abstract: Coupled dynamical systems are frequently observed in nature, but often not
  well under-stood in terms of their causal structure without additional domain knowledge
  about the system. Especially when analyzing observational time series data of dynamical
  systems where it is not possible to conduct controlled experiments, for example
  time series of cli-mate variables, it can be challenging to determine how features
  causally influence each other. There are many techniques available to recover causal
  relationships from data, such as Granger causality, convergent cross mapping, and
  causal graph structure learning approaches such as PCMCI. Path signatures and their
  associated signed areas provide a new way to approach the analysis of causally linked
  dynamical systems, particularly in informing a model-free, data-driven approach
  to algorithmic causal discovery. With this paper, we explore the use of path signatures
  in causal discovery and propose the application of confidence sequences to analyze
  the significance of the magnitude of the signed area between two variables. These
  confidence sequence regions converge with greater sampling length,and in conjunction
  with analyzing pairwise signed areas across time-shifted versions of the time series,
  can help identify the presence of lag/lead causal relationships. This approach provides
  a new way to define the confidence of a causal link existing between two time series,
  and ultimately may provide a framework for hypothesis testing to define whether
  one time series causes another.
